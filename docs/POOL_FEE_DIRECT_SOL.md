# ✅ Pool Creation Fee - NOW DIRECT SOL!

## 🎉 MAJOR IMPROVEMENT

The contract has been updated to transfer **native SOL directly** to your wallet instead of wrapping it to WSOL!

---

## 🔧 What Changed

### ❌ Before (WSOL Method):
```
Pool Creation → 0.15 SOL → Wrapped to WSOL → Stored in token account
                                           ↓
                          You need to unwrap manually later
```

### ✅ Now (Direct SOL):
```
Pool Creation → 0.15 SOL → Directly to your wallet
                         ↓
              Immediately available as native SOL! 🎉
```

## 📋 Updated Configuration

```json
{
  "programId": "2LdLPZbRokzmcJyFE7fLyTgMKNxuR9PE6PKfunn6fkUi",
  "createPoolFeeReceiver": "67D6TM8PTsuv8nU5PnUP3dV6j8kW3rmTD9KNufcEUPCa",
  "createPoolFee": "0.15 SOL (150,000,000 lamports)"
}
```

**Note:** The WSOL account (`FRX2thfNDB3MhHYHhcGZFiVK7NbuY2HzGn9WQDtAGBvX`) is no longer needed!

## 💰 How It Works Now

When someone creates a pool:

1. ✅ Contract charges **0.15 SOL** from pool creator
2. ✅ **Direct transfer** to: `67D6TM8PTsuv8nU5PnUP3dV6j8kW3rmTD9KNufcEUPCa`
3. ✅ **SOL appears immediately** in the fee receiver's wallet
4. ✅ **No unwrapping needed** - it's already native SOL!

## 🗑️ Cleanup (Optional)

If you created the WSOL account earlier, you can close it to reclaim rent:

```bash
npx ts-node scripts/unwrap-pool-fees.ts
```

But this is **optional** - the contract no longer uses it!
